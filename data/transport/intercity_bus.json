  "intro": "While the High Speed Rail (THSR) has reduced the frequency of some ultra-long-haul bus routes, the <strong>Intercity Highway Bus</strong> network remains the backbone of Taiwan's transport. It is the cheapest way to travel and essential for reaching areas without trains. For medium distances, it often functions like a 'commuter metro' for locals.",

      "content": "<p>In Taiwan, you can distinguish the type of bus by its route number:</p><ul><li><strong>City Bus (市區公車):</strong> Usually <strong>1 to 3 digits</strong> (e.g., Bus 307). These stay within one city/county.</li><li><strong>Highway/Intercity Bus (國道/公路客運):</strong> Usually <strong>4 digits</strong> (e.g., 1815, 9006). These travel via highways to cross city/county borders.</li></ul><h3>The 'Commuter' Culture</h3><p>Don't be surprised to see long queues for these 4-digit buses during rush hour. Many locals live in neighboring cities (like Keelung or Yilan) but work in Taipei. They take these highway buses daily just like taking a subway. For example, <strong>Bus 1550</strong> whisks people from Keelung directly to Taipei in 30-40 minutes.</p>",
