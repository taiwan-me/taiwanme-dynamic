      "content": "<p><strong>YouBike</strong> is the dominant public bike system in almost every major city (Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Pingtung). <strong>Note:</strong> Keelung City does NOT have YouBike due to its steep, hilly terrain.</p><h3>🚴‍♂️ Membership vs. Single Rental</h3><ul><li><strong>For Residents / Long-term:</strong> Download the <a href='https://www.youbike.com.tw/region/main/' target='_blank'>YouBike 2.0 App</a>. Register with a <strong>Taiwan Mobile Number</strong>. You can bind an EasyCard, iPASS, or Credit Card for payment.</li><li><strong>For Short-term Tourists (Single Rental):</strong> If you don't have a local number, choose <strong>'Single Rental' (單次租車)</strong> in the App.<br>1. Bind a Credit Card.<br>2. A pre-authorization deposit of <strong>NT$3,000</strong> will be held (refunded automatically after returning the bike, processing time depends on the bank).<br>3. Scan the QR code on the bike to ride.</li></ul><h3>🟡 Bike Types</h3><ul><li><strong>Yellow (2.0):</strong> Standard bike. 3-speed gears. Cheap and reliable.</li><li><strong>Orange/White (2.0E):</strong> Electric-assist bike. Provides power when you pedal. Great for hills or long distances but costs slightly more.</li></ul><h3>📍 Finding & Returning</h3><ul><li><strong>Find a Station:</strong> Use Google Maps (search 'YouBike') or the App map.</li><li><strong>Cross-City Return:</strong> You CAN return bikes across neighboring cities (e.g., rent in Taipei, return in New Taipei). *Check the app for fees if crossing distant regions.*</li><li><strong>Cost:</strong> Very affordable. Short rides usually cost around <strong>NT$30</strong> or less.</li></ul>",

However, there are strict unwritten rules you must follow.</p><h3>⚠️ Critical Rules</h3><ul><li><strong>Wave Your Hand:</strong> You MUST wave at the driver as the bus approaches. If you just stand there looking at your phone, the driver will not stop.</li><li><strong>Tap On & Tap Off:</strong> Swipe your IC Card (EasyCard/iPASS) when you get on AND when you get off. Failing to do so will lock your card.</li><li><strong>The Bell:</strong> Press the red/yellow bell button before your stop. <strong>WARNING:</strong> Do NOT press the button covered with a plastic cap or labeled 'Sexual Harassment Prevention' (性騷擾防治). This triggers a loud emergency alarm.</li></ul><h3>📱 Tracking the Bus</h3><p><strong>Do not rely solely on Google Maps ETA</strong> during rush hours; it can be delayed by 5-10 minutes. </p><ul><li><strong>Bus Tracker Apps:</strong> Use apps like 'Bus+ (Bus Plus)' or 'Taiwan Bus' for real-time GPS tracking.</li><li><strong>Electronic Signs:</strong> Most city bus stops have LED signs showing 'Min to arrival'. These are usually the most accurate.</li></ul>",

You can set the destination in English and pay via credit card in the app, avoiding language barriers and cash handling.</li><li><strong><a href='https://www.linego.me/' target='_blank'>LINE GO</a>:</strong> A service built into the LINE app (Taiwan's main chat app). Often offers coupons and cheaper rates than Uber, utilizing a large fleet of taxis.</li><li><strong>55688 (Taiwan Taxi):</strong> The largest local fleet. Good availability but the app interface varies in English support.</li></ul><h3>🖐️ Street Hail (Yellow Cabs)</h3><ul><li>Available everywhere in cities. Look for the red 'Vacant' (空車) light.</li><li>Payment is mostly <strong>Cash</strong>. Some accept EasyCard or Credit Card, but don't count on it unless you ask first.</li></ul>",
