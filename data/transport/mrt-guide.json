  "intro": "Taiwan currently has operational MRT systems in <strong>Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan, Taichung, and Kaohsiung</strong>. While Taipei and Kaohsiung have the most mature networks, Taoyuan and Taichung are actively expanding. Other cities like Keelung, Hsinchu, Chiayi, and especially <strong>Tainan</strong>—the cultural capital with high tourist density—are currently planning their own networks.<br><br><strong>A Note on Light Rail (LRT):</strong> You will also see Light Rail Transit in New Taipei and Kaohsiung. These are slower, similar to <strong>streetcars in Australia</strong>. They are favored for their lower cost, shorter construction time, and ability to weave through city streets, making them excellent for connecting High Speed Rail stations to city centers.",

This rule is strictly enforced, and violators face heavy fines. This unique cleanliness culture is why Taiwan's metro is famous for being spotless.</p>",
